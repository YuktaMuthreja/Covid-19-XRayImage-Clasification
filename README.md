# Covid-19 X ray Image-Clasification

# Project Overview:

## PCA Image Analysis:

- Applied PCA to X-ray images.
- Determined the number of components needed to preserve 95% of variance.

## Image Reconstruction:

- Plotted 10 original images and their reconstructions after PCA.

##2D Visualization with PCA:

- Used PCA to reduce dimensionality to 2.
- Plotted a 2D scatter plot colored by medical condition category.
- Visualized X-ray image features influencing variance.

## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:

- Repeated steps for t-SNE, LLE, and MDS.
- Visualized clusters similarly to PCA.

## K-Means Clustering:

- Used PCA for K-Means clustering.
- Determined clusters with a technique discussed in class.
- Visualized clusters based on X-ray categories.

##EM Clustering:

- Applied EM clustering with PCA.
- Determined clusters with a class-discussed technique.
- Visualized clusters based on X-ray categories.

## Neural Network Classification:

Built a feedforward neural network for rock classification.
Used '120 Rocks' as validation data.
Trained the network, reported training time.
Loss and Accuracy Plot:

Plotted training and validation loss/accuracy.

## Result

Received an accuracy score of 94%
